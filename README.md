**Goal:** Create a simple, virtual filesystem that supports the following features:

- Creating, deleting and renaming files over a root directory;
- Opening, closing, reading and writing to those files;
- The filesystem should be accessible from a socket (server - client model);
- Files should have the concept of owner and permissions (read and write, both for owner and for others);
- Server should handle signals and be able to interact with more than one user at a time (multithread deployment).
